## Linear Regression to Predict MPG 

Vehicle length and ground clearance are likely to cause a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. There is also evidence that suggests vehicle weight may have a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. 

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. This is the case because the p-value is less than the signifcance value of 0.05 at 5.35e-11. 

The Multiple R-Squared is 0.7149. This shows that the linear model can effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes at 71.49%.
